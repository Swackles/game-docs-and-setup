## Tutorial

There are two types of radios **LR**, which stands for Long Range and **SR**, which stands for short range. Usually LR radios are the ones you carry on your back (RED) and SR on your body (GREEN).

You can change the channel you're talking on by using the numpand on SR and ctrl+numpad on LR.
